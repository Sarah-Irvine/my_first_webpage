# my_first_webpage
A simple webpage design I created after completing the first week of my CodeClan web development course. It is very simple but I am proud of it as it's the first thing I created after 1 week of learning HTML and CSS.

The illustrations are my own drawings and the photographs are my own photos of things I have knitted.
